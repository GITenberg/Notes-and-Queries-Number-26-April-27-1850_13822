<h2>NOTES</h2>
<h3>NICHOLAS BRETON.</h3>
<p>Like Mr. COLLIER (No. 23. p. 364.), I have for many years felt
"a peculiar interest about Nicholas Breton," and an anxious desire
to learn something more of him, not only from being a sincere lover
of many of his beautiful lyrical and pastoral poems, as exhibited
in <i>England's Helicon</i>, <i>Davison's Poetical Rhapsodie</i>,
and other numerous works of his own, and from possessing several
pieces of his which are not generally known, but also from my
intimate connection with the parish in which he is supposed to have
lived and died. From this latter circumstance, especially, I had
been most anxious to connect his name with Norton, and have
frequently cast a reverential and thoughtful eye on the simple
monument which has been supposed to record his name; hoping, yet
not without doubts, that some evidence would still be found which
would prove it to be really that of the poet. It was therefore with
the utmost pleasure that I read Mr. Collier's concluding paragraph,
that he is "in possession of undoubted proof that he was the
Nicholas Breton whose epitaph is on the chancel-wall of the church
of Norton in Northamptonshire."</p>
<p>It seems strange that, notwithstanding the number and variety of
his writings, the length of time he was before the public, and the
estimation in which he was held by his contemporaries, so little
should be known concerning Breton, and the circumstances of his
life be still involved in such great obscurity. In looking over his
various publications, it is remarkable how little is to be gleaned
in the preliminary prefixes which relate to his own personal
history, and how very rarely he touches on any thing referring to
himself. There is a plaintive and melancholy strain running through
many of his works, and I am inclined to the opinion entertained by
Sir Egerton Bridges and others, that cares, and misfortunes, and
continued disappointments had brought on melancholy and despair,
and that the plaintive and touching nature of his writings were
occasioned by real sorrows and sufferings. This seems at variance
with his being the purchaser of the manor and lordship of Norton,
and in the possession and enjoyment of this world's goods. Thus in
his <i>Auspicante Jehova Maries Exercise</i>, 8vo. 1597, one of the
rarest of his works, in the dedication to Mary, Countess of
Pembroke, speaking of his temporal condition, he remarks, "I have
soncke my fortune in the worlde, hauing only the light of vertue to
leade my hope unto Heauen:" and signs himself "Your La. sometime
unworthy Poet, and now, and ever poore Beadman, Nich. Breton." And
the "Address" after it is signed, "Your poore friend or servant
N.B." I am aware that these phrases are sometimes used in a
figurative sense, but am disposed to think that here they are
intended for something real. And I am at a loss how to reconcile
these expressions of poverty with his being the purchaser and
enjoyer of such an estate. I shall wait, therefore, with
considerable anxiety till it may suit the pleasure or convenience
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page410" id=
"page410"></a>{410}</span> of Mr. Collier to communicate to the
world the proofs he has obtained of the poet's identification with
the Norton monument. I would, however, further add, that so late as
1606, the Dedication to <i>the Praise of Vertuous Ladies</i> is
dated "From my Chamber in the Blacke-Fryers," and that not one of
his later productions is dated from Norton, which probably would
have been the case had he been resident there.</p>
<p>I regret that I am unable to afford Mr. Collier any information
respecting the "Crossing of Proverbs," beyond the fact of the late
Mr. Rodd being the purchaser of Mr. Heber's fragment, but whether
on commission or not, I cannot say, nor where it now is. The same
kind of proverbs are given in <i>Wit's Private Wealth</i>, 1603,
and in some other of his works.</p>
<p>Nicholas Breton, besides being a pleasing and polished writer of
lyric and pastoral poetry, appears to have been a close and
attentive observer of nature and manners,&mdash;abounding in wit
and humour,&mdash;and a pious and religious man. He was also a
soldier, a good fisherman, and a warm admirer of Queen Elizabeth,
of whom he gives a beautiful character in "<i>A Dialogue full of
pithe and pleasure, upon the Dignitie or Indignitie of Man</i>,"
4to., 1603, on the reverse of Sig. c. iii.</p>
<p>As it is sometimes desirable to know where copies of the rarer
productions of a writer are to be met with, I may state, that among
some five or six-and-twenty of this author's pieces, besides the
<i>Auspicante Jehova Maries Exercise</i>, 8vo. 1597, already
mentioned, of which I know of no other copy than my own, I possess
also the only one of <i>A small handfull of Fragrant Flowers</i>,
8vo. 1575, and <i>A Floorish upon Fancie</i>, 4to. 1582, both
reprinted in the Heliconia; <i>Marie Magdalen's Loue</i>, with <i>A
Solemne Passion of the Soules Loue</i>, 8vo. 1595, the first part
in prose, the latter in six-line stanzas, and very rare;
<i>Fantastics: seruing for a Perpetual Prognostication</i>, 4to.
1626; and <i>Wit's Trenchmour, In a conference had betwixt a
Scholler and an Angler. Written by Nich. Breton, Gentleman</i>,
4to. bl. lett. 1597, the only copy known and not included in
Lowndes's list, which, from the style of its composition and the
similarity of some of the remarks, is supposed to have been the
original work from which Izaac Walton first took the idea of his
<i>Complete Angler</i>.</p>

<h3>NOTES UPON CUNNINGHAM'S HANDBOOK FOR LONDON.</h3>
<p><i>Baldwin's Gardens.</i>&mdash;A passage upon the east side of
Gray's Inn Lane, leading into Leather Lane. Tom Brown dates some
introductory verses, prefixed to Playford's <i>Pleasant Musical
Companion</i>, 1698, "from Mr. Steward's, at the Hole-in-the-Wall,
in <i>Baldwin's Gardens</i>." There is extant a single sheet with
an engraved head, published by J. Applebee, 1707, and
called,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The English and French Prophets mad, or bewitcht, at their
assemblies in <i>Baldwin's Gardens</i>."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A Letter of Anthony Wood's, in the writer's collection, is thus
addressed:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"For John Aubrey, Esq. To be left at Mr. Caley's house, in
<i>Baldwin's Gardens</i>, neare Gray's Inne Lane, London."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>The White Hart, Bishopsgate Street.</i>&mdash;A tavern said
to be of very ancient date. In front of the present building, the
writer of the present notice observed (in 1838) the date cut in
stone, 1480.</p>
<p><i>The Nag's Head, Cheapside.</i>&mdash;A view of this tavern is
preserved in a print of the entry of Mary de Medici, when she paid
a visit to her son-in-law and daughter, the unfortunate Charles I.
and his queen.</p>
<p><i>St. Paul's Alley.</i>&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Whereas, the yearly meeting of the name of Adam hath of late,
through the deficiency of the last stewards, been neglected, these
are to give notice to all gentlemen, and others that are of that
name, that, at William Adams', commonly called 'The Northern
Alehouse,' in <i>St. Paul's Alley</i>, in St. Paul's Church Yard,
there will be a weekly meeting, every Monday night, of our
namesakes, between the hours of 6 and 8 of the clock in the
evening, in order to choose stewards to revive our antient and
annual feast."&mdash;<i>Domestic Intelligence</i>, 1681.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>St. Paul's Churchyard.</i>&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In St. Paul's Church Yard were formerly many shops where music
and musical instruments were sold, for which, at this time, no
better reason can be given than that the service at that Cathedral
drew together, twice a day, all the lovers of music in London; not
to mention that the chairmen were wont to assemble there, where
they were met by their friends and acquaintance."&mdash;<i>Sir John
Hawkins' History of Music</i>, vol. v. p. 108.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>The French Change, Soho.</i>&mdash;A place so called in the
reign of Queen Anne. Gough, in a MS. note, now before us, thought
it stood on the site of the present bazaar.</p>

<hr />
<h3>NOTES ON THE DODO.</h3>
<p>I have to thank "Mr. S.W. SINGER" (No. 22. p. 353.) for giving
some interesting replies to my "Dodo Queries" (No. 17. p. 261.). I
trust that Mr. S. will be induced to pursue the inquiry further,
and especially to seek for some <i>Portuguese</i> account of the
Mascarene Islands, prior to the Dutch expedition of 1598. I am now
able to state that the supposed proof of the discovery of Bourbon
by the Portuguese in 1545, on the authority of a stone pillar, the
figure of which Leguat has copied <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page411" id="page411"></a>{411}</span> from Du Qesne, who copied
it from Flacourt, turns out to be inaccurate. On referring to
Flacourt's <i>Histoire de la Grande Isle Madagascar</i>, 4to.,
Paris, 1658, p. 344, where the original figure of this monument is
given, I find that the stone was not found in Bourbon at all, but
in "l'Islet des Portugais," a small island at the mouth of the
river Fanshere (see Flacourt, p. 32.), near the S.E. extremity of
Madagascar. From this place Flacourt removed it to the neighbouring
settlement of Fort Dauphin in 1653, and engraved the arms of France
on the opposite side to those of Portugal. We are therefore still
without any historical record of the first discovery of Bourbon and
Mauritius, though, from the unanimous consent of later compilers,
we may fairly presume that the Portuguese were the discoverers.</p>
<p>The references which Mr. Singer has given to two works which
mention the <i>Oiseau bleu</i> of Bourbon, are very important, as
the only other known authority for this extinct bird is the MS.
Journal of Sieur D.B., which thus receives full confirmation. May I
ask Mr. Singer whether either of these writers mentions the
<i>Solitaire</i> as inhabiting Bourbon?</p>
<p>The "Oiseaux appelez <i>Flamands</i>" quoted by Mr. S., are
merely <i>Flamingos</i>, and are devoid of interest as regards the
present question.</p>
<p>The history of the Dodo's head at Copenhagen, referred to by Mr.
Singer, is fully recorded in the <i>Dodo and its Kindred</i>, pp.
25. 33.</p>
<p>The name <i>Dodo</i> seems to have been first applied to the
bird by Sir Thomas Herbert, in 1634, who adds, in his edition of
1638, "a Portuguese name it is, and has reference to her
simpleness." Before that time the Dutch were in the habit of
calling it <i>Dodars</i>, <i>Dodaers</i>, <i>Toters</i>, and
<i>Dronte</i>. I had already made the same guesses at the etymology
of these words as those which Mr. Singer has suggested, but not
feeling fully satisfied with them, I put forth my Query VII. for
the chance of obtaining some further elucidation.</p>
<p>Mr. Singer's reasonings on the improbability of Tradescant's
specimen of the Dodo having been a fabrication are superfluous,
seeing that the head and foot of this individual are, as is well
known, still in existence, and form the subjects of six plates in
the <i>Dodo and its Kindred</i>.</p>
<p>In regard to my Query IX. as to the local habitation of the
family of <i>Dronte</i>, who bore a Dodo on their shield, it has
been suggested to me by the Rev. Richard Hooper (who first drew my
attention to this armorial bearing), that the family was probably
foreign to Britain. It appears that there was a family named
<i>Dodo</i>, in Friesland, a member of which (Augustin Dodo,
deceased in 1501) was the first editor of St. Augustine's works.
Mr. Hooper suggests that possibly this family may have subsequently
adopted the Dodo as their arms, and that Randle Holme may, by a
natural mistake, have changed the name of the family, in his
<i>Academy of Armory</i>, from <i>Dodo</i> to the synonymous word
<i>Dronte</i>. Can none of your genealogical readers clear up this
point?</p>

<hr />
<h3>DERIVATION OF "STERLING" AND "PENNY".</h3>
<p>Your correspondent suggests (No. 24. p. 384.) an ingenious
derivation for the word <i>Sterling</i>; but one which perhaps he
has been too ready to adopt, inasmuch as it helped his other
derivation of <i>peny</i>, from <i>pecunia</i> or <i>pecus</i>. I
quote the following from <i>A short Treatise touching Sheriff's
Accompts</i>, by Sir Matthew Hale: London, 1683:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Concerning the second, <i>viz.</i> the matter or species
whereof the current coin of this kingdom hath been made, it is gold
or silver, but not altogether pure, but with an allay of copper, at
least from the time of King H. I. and H. II., though possibly in
ancienter times the species whereof the coin was made might be pure
gold or silver; and this allay was that which gave the denomination
of Sterling to that coin, <i>viz.</i> Sterling Gold, or Sterling
Silver. Wherein there will be inquirable,</p>
<p>"1. Whence that denomination came?</p>
<p>"2. How ancient that denomination was?</p>
<p>"3. What was the allay that gave silver that denomination?</p>
<p>"For the former of these there are various conjectures, and
nothing of certainty.</p>
<p>"<i>Spelman</i> supposeth it to take that denomination from the
Esterlings, who, as he supposeth, came over and reformed our coin
to that allay. Of this opinion was <i>Camden. A Germanis, quos
Angli</i> Esterlings, <i>aborientali situ, vocarunt, facta est
appellatio; quos</i> Johannes <i>Rex, ad argentum in suam puritatem
redigendam, primus evocavit; et ejus modi nummi</i> Esterlingi,
<i>in antiquis scripturis semper reperiuntur</i>. Some suppose that
it might be taken up from the <i>Starre Jud&aelig;orum</i>, who,
being the great brokers for money, accepted and allowed money of
that allay for current payment of their stars or obligations;
others from the impression of a starling, or an asterisk upon the
coin. <i>Pur ceo que le form d'un Stare, dont le diminutive est
Sterling, fuit impressit on stamp sur ceo. Auters pur ceo que le
primer de cest Standard fuit coyn en le Castle de Sterlin in</i>
Scotland <i>pur le Roy</i> Edw. I. And possibly as the proper name
of the fourth part of a Peny was called a Farthing, ordinarily a
Ferling; so in truth the proper name of a Peny in those times was
called a Sterling, without any other reason of it than the use of
the times and arbitrary imposition, as other names usually grow.
For the old Act of 51 H. III., called <i>Compositio Mensurarum</i>,
tells us that <i>Denarius Anglice Sterlingus dicitur</i>; and
because this was the root of the measure, especially of Silver
Coin, therefore all our Coin of the same allay was also called
Sterling, as five Shillings Sterling, five Pounds Sterling.</p>
<p>"When this name of Sterling came first in is uncertain, only we
are certain it was a denomination in use in the time of H. III. or
Ed. I. and after ages. But it was not in use at the time of the
compiling of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page412" id=
"page412"></a>{412}</span> Doomsday, for if it were we should have
found it there where there is so great occasion of mention of
Firmes, Rents, and Payments. Hovended in <i>Rich. I fol. 377.
b.</i> Nummus <i>a</i> Numa, <i>que fuit le primer Roy que fesoit
moneies en</i> Rome. <i>Issint Sterlings, alias Esterlings, queux
primes fesoient le money de cest Standard en</i>
Engleterre."&mdash;<i>Sheriffs' Accompts</i>, p. 5-9.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So much for the derivation of <i>Sterling</i>, which evidently
applied originally to the metal rather than to a coin. May I be
allowed to hazard a suggestion as to the origin of <i>peny</i>, its
synonym? They were each equivalent to the Denarius.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<i>Denarius Angli&aelig;, qui nominatur Sterlingus, rotundus
sine tonsura, ponderabit 32 grana in medio spic&aelig;. Sterlingus
et Denarius sont tout un. Le Shilling consistoit de 12 sterlings.
Le substance de cest denier ou sterling peny al primes fuit
vicessima pars unic&aelig;.</i>"&mdash;<i>Indentures of the
Mint</i>, Ed. I and VI.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>May we not derive it from Denarius by means of either a
typographical or clerical error in the initial letter. This would
at once give a new name&mdash;the very thing they were in want
of&mdash;and we may very easily understand its being shortened into
Penny.</p>

<p>"Mr. Hampson" has served the cause of truth in defending Hanno
and the Carthaginians from the charge of cruelty, brought against
them by Mr. Attorney-General Bannister. A very slender
investigation of the bearings of the narration would have prevented
it. I know not how Dr. Falconer deals with it, not having his
little volume at hand; but in so common a book as the <i>History of
Maritime Discovery</i>, which forms part of Lardner's <i>Cabinet
Cyclop&aelig;dia</i>, it is stated that these <i>Gorill&aelig;</i>
were probably some species of <i>ourang-outang</i>. Purchas says
they might be the <i>baboons</i> or <i>Pongos</i> of those
parts.</p>
<p>The amusing, and always interesting, Italian, Hakluyt, in the
middle of the sixteenth century, gives a very good version of the
[Greek: ANNONOS PERIPLOUS], with a preliminary discourse, which
would also have undeceived Mr. Bannister, had he been acquainted
with it, and prevented Mr. Hampson's pleasant exposure of his
error.</p>
<p>Ramusio says, "Seeing that in the Voyage of Hanno there are many
parts worthy of considerate attention, I have judged that it would
be highly gratifying to the studious if I were here to write down a
few extracts from certain memoranda which I formerly noted on
hearing a respectable Portugese pilot, in frequent conversations
with the Count Raimondo della Torre, at Venice, illustrate this
Voyage of Hanno, when read to him, from his own experience." There
are, of course, some erroneous notions in the information of the
pilot, and in the deductions made from it by Ramusio; but the
former had the sagacity to see the truth respecting this <i>Gorgon
Island full of hairy men and women</i>. I will not spoil the
<i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i> of the narration by attempting a
translation; merely premising that he judged the Island to be that
of Fernando Po.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"E tutta la descrittione de questo Capitano era simile a quella
per alcun Scrittore Greci, quale parlande dell' isola delle
Gorgone, dicono quella esser un isola in mezzo d'una palude. E
conciacosa che havea inteso che li poeti dicevan le Gorgone esser
femine terribili, per&ograve; scrisse che le erano pelose.... Ma a
detto pilotto pareva pi&ugrave; verisimile di pensare, che havendo
Hannone inteso ne'i libri de' poeti come Perseo era stato per
&aelig;re a questa isola, e di quivi reportata la testa di Medusa,
essendo egli ambitioso di far creder al mondo che lui vi fasse
audato per mare; e dar riputation a questo suo viaggio, di esser
penetrato fuio dove era stato Perseo; volesse portar due pelli di
Gorgone, e dedicarla nel tempio di Ginnone. Il che li fu facil cosa
da fare, conciosia cosa che IN TUTTA QUELLA COSTA SI TRUOVINO
INFINITE DI QUELLE SIMIE GRANDE, CHE FARENO PERSONE HUMANE, DELLE
BABUINE, le pelle delle quali poteva far egli credere ad ogniuno
che fussero state di femine."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gopelin, also, in his <i>Recherches sur la G&eacute;ographie des
Anciens</i>, speaking of this part of Hanno's voyage, says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Hanno encountered a troop of <i>Ourang-outangs</i>, which he
took for savages, because these animals walk erect, often having a
staff in their hands to support themselves, as well as for attack
or defence; and they throw stones when they are pursued. They are
the Satyrs and the Argipani with which Pliny says Atlas was
peopled. It would be useless to say more on this subject, as it is
avowed <i>by all the modern commentators of the Periplus</i>."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The relation we have is evidently only an abridgment or summary
made by some Greek, studious of Carthaginian affairs, long
subsequent to the time of Hanno; and judging from a passage in
Pliny (I. ii. c. 67.), it appears that the ancients were acquainted
with other extracts from the original, yet, though its authenticity
has been doubted by Strabo and others, there seems to be little
reason to question that it is a correct <i>outline</i> of the
voyage. That the Carthaginians were oppressors of the people they
subjugated may be probable; yet we must not, on such slender
grounds as this narration affords, presume that they would wantonly
kill and flay <i>human beings</i> to possess themselves of their
skins!</p>

<h3>FOLK LORE.</h3>
<p><i>Cook-eels.</i>&mdash;Forby derives this from <i>coquille</i>,
in allusion to their being fashioned like an escallop, in which
sense he is borne out by Cotgrave, who has "<i>Pain
coquill&eacute;</i>, a fashion of an hard-crusted loafe, somewhat
like our stillyard bunne." I have always taken the word to be
"coquerells," from <span class="pagenum"><a name="page413" id=
"page413"></a>{413}</span> the vending of such buns at the
barbarous sport of "throwing at the cock" on Shrove Tuesday. The
cock is still commonly called a cockerell in E. Anglia. Perhaps Mr.
Wodderspoon will say whether the buns of the present day are
fashioned in any particular manner, or whether any "the oldest
inhabitant" has any recollection of their being differently
fashioned or at all impressed. What, too, are the "<i>stillyard
buns</i>" of Cotgrave? Are they tea-cakes? The apartment in which
tea was formerly made was called the <i>still</i>-room.</p>
<p class="author">Buriensis.</p>
<p><i>Divination by the Bible and Key.</i>&mdash;This superstition
is very prevalent amongst the peasantry of this and adjoining
parishes. When any article is suspected to have been stolen, a
Bible is procured, and opened at the 1st chap. of Ruth: the stock
of a street-door key is then laid on the 16th verse of the above
chapter, and the key is secured in this position by a string, bound
tightly round the book. The person who works the charm then places
his two middle fingers under the handle of the key, and this keeps
the Bible suspended. He then repeats in succession the names of the
parties suspected of the theft; repeating at each name a portion of
the verse on which the key is placed, commencing, "Whither thou
goest, I will go," &amp;c. When the name of the guilty is
pronounced, the key turns off the fingers, the Bible falls to the
ground, and the guilt of the party is determined. The belief of
some the more ignorant of the lower orders in this charm is
unbounded. I have seen it practiced in other counties, the key
being laid over the 5th verse of the 19th chap. of Proverbs,
instead of the 1st chap. of Ruth.</p>

<p><i>Weather Proverb.</i>&mdash;Weather proverbs are among the
most curious portions of popular literature. That foul or fair
weather is betokened according as the rainbow is seen in the
morning or evening, is recorded in the following German "saw,"
which is nearly identical with our well-known English Proverb:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Regenbogen am Morgen</p>
<p>Macht dem Sch&auml;fer sorgen;</p>
<p>Regenbogen am Abend</p>
<p>Ist dem Sch&auml;fer labend.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In Mr. Akerman's recently published volume called <i>Spring
Tide</i>, a pleasant intermixture of fly-fishing and philology, we
have a Wiltshire version of this proverb, curious for its old Saxon
language and its comparatively modern allusion to a "great coat" in
the third and sixth lines, which must be interpolations.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"The Rainbow in th' marnin'</p>
<p>Gies the Shepherd warning'</p>
<p>To car' his girt cwoat on his back</p>
<p>The Rainbow at night</p>
<p>Is the Shepherd's delight,</p>
<p>For then no girt cwoat he lack."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>No one, we believe, has yet remarked the philosophy of this
saying; namely that in the morning the rainbow is seen in the
clouds in the west, the quarter from which we get most rain, and of
course, in the evening, in the opposite quarter of the heavens.</p>

<hr />
<h3>POPE, PETRONIUS, AND HIS TRANSLATORS.</h3>
<p>The vindication of Pope from the charge of borrowing his
well-known sentiment&mdash;"<i>Worth</i> makes a man,"
&amp;c.&mdash;from Petronius, is not so completely made out by
"P.C.S.S." as it might be; for surely there is a sufficient
similitude of idea, if not of expression, between the couplet of
Pope and the sentence of Petronius, as given in all four of the
translations cited by him (No. 23. p. 362.)&mdash;"The <i>heart</i>
makes the man," &amp;c.&mdash;to warrant a notion that the one was
suggested by the other. But the surmise of plagiarism originates in
a misconception of the terms employed by the Latin
author&mdash;<i>virtus</i>, <i>frugalitas</i>, and more especially
<i>corcillum</i>,&mdash;which have been misunderstood by every one
of these translators. <i>Virtus</i> is applied to mental as well as
bodily superiority (<i>Cic. Fin.</i> v. 13.).&mdash;The sense in
which <i>frugalitas</i> is employed by Petronius may be collected
from a preceding passage in the same chapter, where Trimalchio
calls his pet <i>puerum frugalissimum</i>&mdash;a very
<i>clever</i> lad&mdash;as he explains the epithet by adding that
"he can read at sight, repeat from memory, cast up accounts, and
turn a penny to his own profit." <i>Corcillum</i> is a diminutive
of <i>corculum</i> (like <i>oscillum</i>, from <i>osculum</i>),
itself a diminutive of <i>cor</i>, which word, though commonly put
for "the heart," is also used by the best authors, Lucretius,
Horace, Terence, &amp;c, in the same sense as our <i>wit</i>,
<i>wisdom</i>, <i>intellect</i>. The entire passage, if correctly
translated, might then be expressed as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The time has been, my friends, when I myself was no better off
than you are; but I gained my present position solely by my own
talents (<i>virtute</i>). Wit (<i>corcillum</i>) makes the
man&mdash;(or, literally, It is wisdom that makes men of
us)&mdash;everything else is worthless lumber. I buy in the
cheapest and sell in the dearest market. But, as I said before, my
own shrewdness (<i>frugalitas</i>) made my fortune. I came from
Asia no taller than that lamp stand; and used to measure my height
against it day by day, and grease my muzzle (<i>rostrum</i>) with
oil from the lamp to make a beard come."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then follow some additional examples of the youth's sagacity,
not adapted for translation, but equally instances of worldly
wisdom. Thus every one of the actions which Trimalchio enumerated
as the causes of his prosperity are emanations from the
<i>head</i>, not the <i>heart</i>; the results of a crafty
intellect, not of moral feeling; so that the sentiment he
professes, instead of being similar to, is exactly the reverse of
that expressed by Pope.</p>
<p>This explanation seems so satisfactory that we might be well
contented to rest here. But some MSS. have the reading
<i>coricillum</i> instead of <i>corcillum</i>. If that be received
as the genuine one, and some editors prefer it, the interpretation
above given will only be slightly modified, but not destroyed, by
the introduction of another image, the essential point remaining
the same. The insertion of a vowel, <i>i</i>, precludes all
connection with <i>cor</i> and its diminutives, but suggests a
derivation from [Greek: korukos], dim. [Greek: korukion], a
leathern sack or bag, which, when well stuffed, the Greeks used to
suspend in the gymnasium, like the pendulum of a clock (as may be
seem on a fictile vase), to buffet to and fro with blows of the
fist. The stuffed bag will represent the human head on the end of
its trunk; and the word may have been a slang one of the day, or
coined by the Asiatic Trimalchio, whose general language is filled
with provincial patois. The translation would then be, in the
familiar style of the original,&mdash;"The <i>noddle</i> makes the
man," &amp;c.</p>

<h2>QUERIES.</h2>
<h3>WHEN WERE UMBRELLAS INTRODUCED INTO ENGLAND?</h3>
<p>Thomas Coryat, in his <i>Crudities</i>, vol. i. p. 134., gives
us a curious notice of the early use of the umbrella in Italy.
Speaking of fans, he says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"These fans are of a mean price, for a man may buy one of the
fairest of them for so much money as countervaileth one English
groat. Also many of them (the Italians) do carry other fine things
of a far greater price, that will cost at the least a ducat, which
they commonly call in the Italian tongue <i>umbrellaes</i>, that
is, things that minister shadow unto them for shelter against the
scorching heat of the sun. These are made of leather, something
answerable to the form of a little canopy, and hooped in the inside
with diverse little wooden hoops that extend the <i>umbrella</i> in
a pretty large compass. They are used especially by horsemen, who
carry them in their hands when they ride, fastening the end of the
handle upon one of their thighs: and they impart so long a shadow
unto them, that it keepeth the heat of the sun from the upper parts
of their bodies."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lt.-Col. (afterwards Gen.) Wolfe, writing from Paris, in the
year 1752, says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The people here use umbrellas in hot weather to defend them
from the sun, and something of the same kind to secure them from
snow and rain. I wonder a practice so useful is not introduced in
England, (where there are such frequent showers,) and especially in
the country, where they can be expanded without any
inconveniency."</p>

<h2>REPLIES.</h2>
<h3>GRAY'S ALCAIC ODE.</h3>
<p>Circumstances enable me to give a reply, which I believe will be
found correct, to the inquiry of "C.B." in p. 382. of your 24th
Number, "Whether Gray's celebrated Latin Ode is actually to be
found entered at the Grande Chartreuse?" The fact is, that the
French Revolution&mdash;that whirlwind which swept from the earth
all that came within its reach and seemed elevated enough to offer
opposition&mdash;spared not the poor monks of the Chartreuse. A
rabble from Grenoble and other places, attacked the monastery;
burnt, plundered, or destroyed their books, papers, and property,
and dispersed the inmates; while the buildings were left standing,
not from motives of respect, but because they would have been
troublesome and laborious to pull down, and were not sufficiently
combustible to burn.</p>
<p>In travelling on the Continent with a friend, during the summer
of 1817, we made a pilgrimage to the Grande Chartreuse, reaching it
from the side of the Echelles. It was an interesting moment; for at
that very time the scattered remains of the society had collected
together, and were just come again to take possession of and
reinhabit their old abode. And being their <i>jour de
spaciment</i>, the whole society was before us, as they returned
from their little pilgrimage up the mountain, where they had been
visiting St. Bruno's chapel and spring; and it was impossible not
to think with respect of the self-devotion of these men, who, after
having for many years partaken (in a greater or less degree) of the
habits and comforts of a civilised life, had thus voluntarily
withdrawn themselves once more to their stern yet beautiful
solitude (truly, as Gray calls it, a <i>locus severus</i>), there
to practise the severities of their order, without, it may be
supposed, any possessions or means, except what they were
themselves enabled to throw into a common stock; for nearly the
whole of their property had been seized by the government during
the Revolution, and was still held by it.</p>
<p>Our conversation was almost wholly with two of the fathers (they
use the prefix <i>Dom</i>), whose names I forget, and have mislaid
my memorandum of them. One of these had been in England, when
driven out; and was there protected by the Weld family in
Dorsetshire, of whom he spoke in terms of sincere gratitude and
respect. The other told us that he was a native of Chambery, and
had done no more than cross the mountains to get home. On asking
him for Gray's Ode, he shook his head, saying, the Revolution had
robbed them of that, and every thing else; but repeated the first
line of it, so that there was no mistake as to the object of my
inquiry. From what occurred afterwards, it appears, however, to be
questionable whether he knew more than the first line; for I was
informed that later English travellers had been attempting, from a
laudable desire of diffusing information, to write out the whole in
the present Album of the Chartreuse, by contributing a line or
stanza, as their recollection served; but that, after all, this
pic-nic composition was not exactly what Gray wrote. Of course, had
our friend the Dom known how to supply the deficiencies, he would
have done it.</p>
<p>There is a translation of the Ode by James Hay Beattie, son of
the professor and poet, printed amongst his poems, which is much
less known than its merits deserve. And I would beg to suggest to
such of your readers as may in the course of their travels visit
this monastery, that books (need I say <i>proper</i> ones?) would
be a most acceptable present to the library; also, that there is a
regular Album kept, in which those who, in this age of "talent" and
"intelligence," consider themselves able to write better lines than
Gray's, are at liberty to do so if they please.</p>
<p>A very happy conjecture appeared in the <i>European Magazine</i>
some time between 1804 and 1808, as to the conclusion of the
stanzas to Mr. Beattie. The corner of the paper on which they had
been written as torn off; and Mr. Mason supplies what is deficient
in the following manner, the words added by him being printed in
Italics:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Enough for me, if to some feeling breast</p>
<p class="i2">My lines a secret sympathy <i>impart</i>;</p>
<p>And as their pleasing influence <i>flows confest</i>,</p>
<p class="i2">A sign of soft reflection <i>heave the
heart</i>."</p>
</div>
</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page417" id=

<p>This, it will be seen, is prosaic enough; but the correspondent
of the <i>E. Mag.</i> supposes the lines to have ended differently;
and that the poet, in some peculiar fit of modesty, tore off the
name. His version is this:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">

<p>One word upon another poet, Byron <i>v</i>. Tacitus, in p. 390.
of your 24th Number. There can be no doubt that the noble writer
had this passage of Tacitus in his mind, when he committed the
couplet in question to paper; but, in all probability, he
considered it so well known as not to need acknowledgment. Others
have alluded to it in the same way. The late Rev. W. Crowe, B.C.L.,
of New College, Oxford, and public orator of that University, in
some lines recited by his son at the installation of Lord

<h3>REPLIES TO MINOR QUERIES.</h3>
<p><i>Chapels.</i>&mdash;Perhaps the following remarks will be of
service to "Mr. GATTY" in the solution of his Queries touching the
word <i>Chapel</i> (No. 21.).</p>
<p>Spelman (<i>Glossary, sub voce</i>) endeavours to convince us
that <i>capella</i> is the same as <i>capsella</i>, the diminutive
of <i>capsa</i>; thus making <i>chapel</i>, in the first instance,
"a small repository" (<i>sc.</i> of relics). Richardson is also in
favour of this etymon, notwithstanding its harshness and
insipidity. I think the common derivation (from <i>capella</i>,
diminutive of <i>capa</i>) very much preferable to any other, both
on the score of philology and of history. Ducange has quoted
several passages, all tending to evince that <i>capella</i>
(explained by the Teutonic <i>voccus</i>) was specially applied to
the famous vestment of St. Martin, comprising his cloak and hood
(not merely his <i>hat</i>, as some writers mention). The name was
then metonymically transferred to the repository in which that
relic was preserved, and afterwards, by a natural expansion, became
the ordinary designation of the smaller sanctuaries. This
derivation is distinctly affirmed by Walafred Strabo about 842, and
by a monk of St. Gall, placed by Basnage about 884. The earliest
instance where the word <i>capella</i> is used for the vestment of
St. Martin appears to be in a "Placitum" of Theodoric, King of
France, who ascended the throne A.D. 672&mdash;"in oratorio nostro
super capella Domini Martini ... h&aelig;c dibiret conjurare." In a
second "Placitum," also quoted by Ducange, of Childebert, King of
France (<i>circa</i> 695), the word <i>capella</i> seems to mean a
<i>sacred building</i>&mdash;"in oratorio suo seu capella Sancti
Marthini." And in a charter of Charles the Simple, <i>circ.</i>
900, the term unquestionably occurs in this latter signification,
disconnected from St. Martin. Other illustrations may be seen in
Ducange, who has bestowed especial industry on the words
<i>capa</i> and <i>capella</i>.</p>
<p>With respect to the <i>legal</i> definition of the modern
<i>chapel</i>, I may mention that, in stat. 7 &amp; 8 Geo. IV. c.
29. s. 10., it signifies, according to Mr. Stephens (<i>Eccl.
Statutes</i>, p. 1357.), "a chapel where the rites and ceremonies
of the Church of England are performed, and does not include the
chapels of Dissenters." In stat. 7 &amp; 8 Geo. IV. c. 30., we
read, notwithstanding, of "any <i>chapel</i> for the religious
worship of persons dissenting from the United Church of England and
Ireland."</p>
<p class="author">C.H.</p>
<p>St. Catharine's Hall, Cambridge.</p>
<p><i>Chapels</i> (No. 20. p. 333., and No. 23. p. 371.).&mdash;The
opinion of the "BARRISTER" that this term had come into use as a
designation of dissenting places of worship from no "idea of either
assistance or opposition to the Church of England," but only as a
supposed means of security to the property, is probably correct.
Yet it is likely different reasons may have had weight in different
places.</p>
<p>However, he is mistaken in "believing that we must date the
adoption of that term from about" forty years ago. I am seventy-six
years old, and I can bear testimony, that from my infancy it was
the term universally employed in Yorkshire, Derbyshire, Cheshire,
Lancashire, and, I think probable, in the more northern counties.
In common speech, it was used as the word of discrimination from
the Methodist places of worship, which bore the name of
<i>Meeting-houses</i>, or, more generally, <i>Meetings</i>. But
within the period (forty years) assigned by your learned
correspondent, I think that I have observed the habit to have
extensively obtained of applying the term <i>Chapels</i> to the
latter class of places.</p>
<p>I have abundant evidence of the general use of the term for
dissenting buildings, back to the seventeenth century. From my
early life, I remember the current opinion to have been that
<i>Chapel</i> was the word in use north of the Trent, and
<i>Meeting-house</i> in Nottingham and southwards.</p>

<p><i>Beaver</i> (No. 21. p. 338.).&mdash;The earliest form of this
word is <i>fiber</i>, which is used to signify the animal, the
<i>Castor</i>, by Varro and Pliny. The fabulous story of the
self-emasculation by which the beaver eludes pursuit, is thus
introduced by Silius, in illustrating the flight of
Hasdrubal:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Sterne's Koran</i> (No. 14. p. 216.)&mdash;An inquiry
respecting this work appeared in the <i>Gent. Mag.</i>, vol. lxvii.
pt. ii. p. 565.; and at p. 755. we are told by a writer under the
signature of "Normanus," that in <i>his</i> edition of Sterne,
printed at Dublin, 1775, 5 vols. 12mo., the Koran was placed at the
end, the editor honestly confessing that it was <i>not</i> the
production of Sterne, but of Mr. Richard Griffith (son of Mrs.
Griffith, the <i>Novellettist</i>), then a gentleman of large
fortune seated at Millecent, co. Kildare, and married to a daughter
of the late Ld. C.B. Burgh.</p>
<p>I possess a copy of an indifferent edition of Sterne's works, in
point of paper and type, "Printed for J. Mozley, Gainsbrough, 1795.
8 vols. 12mo." The Koran is in the sixth vol., termed "The
Posthumous Works of L. Sterne," dedicated to the Earl of Charlemont
by the editor, who, in his address to the reader, professes to have
received the MS. from the hands of the author some time before his
untimely death.</p>
<p>This I hope will answer the Query of "E.L.N.:" and at the same
time I wish to express my regret, that we do not possess a really
good and complete edition of Sterne's Works, with a Life and
literary history of them, incorporating the amusing illustrations
by Dr. Ferriar.</p>

<p><i>Lollius.</i>&mdash;In answer to "J.M.B." (No. 19. p. 303.) as
to who was the Lollius spoken of by Chaucer, I send you the
following. <i>Lollius</i> was the real or fictitious name of the
author or translator of many of our Gothic prose romances.
D'Israeli, in his admirable <i>Amenities of Literature</i>, vol. i.
p. 141., says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In some colophons of the prose romances the names of real
persons are assigned as the writers; but the same romance is
equally ascribed to different persons, and works are given as
translations which in fact are originals. Amid this prevailing
confusion, and these contradictory statements, we must agree with
the editor of Warton, that we cannot with any confidence name the
author of any of these prose romances. Ritson has aptly treated
these pseudonymous translators as 'men of straw.' We may say of
them all, as the antiquary Douce, in the agony of his baffled
researches after one of their favourite authorities, a Will o' the
Wisp named LOLLIUS, exclaimed, somewhat gravely,&mdash;'Of Lollius
it will become every one to speak with diffidence.'"</p>

have entered England about the time of the cuckoo's appearance, the
idea that the bird was the precursor of the Welsh might thus become
prevalent. Also, on the quotation given by "PETIT ANDR&Eacute;"
(No. 18. p. 283.) of Welsh parsley, or hempen halters, it may have
derived its origin from the severity practised on the Welsh, in the
time of their independence, when captured on the English side of

ancients have compared them to bulls."</p>

<p><i>Horns</i> (No. 24. p. 383.).&mdash;1. Moses' face, Ex. ch.
xxxiv. (<i>karan</i>, Heb.), shot out beams or <i>horns</i> of
light (from <i>keren</i>, Heb.); so the first beams of the rising
sun are by the Arabian poets compared to horns. Absurdly rendered
by Aqu. and Vulg. (facies) <i>cornuta erat</i>. Whence painters

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page420" id=
"page420"></a>{420}</span>
<p>2. There appear many reasons for likening rivers to bulls.
Euripides calls Cephisus taumomorphos, and Horace gives Aufidus the
same epithet, for the same reason probably, as makes him call it
also "longe sonans," "violentus," and "acer;" viz., the bull-like
roaring of its waters, and the blind fury of its course, especially
in flood time. Other interpretations may be given: thus, Milton,
Dryden, and others, speak of the "horned flood," <i>i.e.</i>, a
body of water which, when it meets with any obstruction, divides
itself and becomes <i>horned</i>, as it were. See Milt. P.L. xi.
831., and notes on the passage by Newton and Todd. Dryden speaks of
"the seven-fold <i>horns</i> of the Nile," using the word as
equivalent to winding stream. It would be tedious to multiply
examples.</p>
<p>3. Of this phrase I have never seen a satisfactory explanation.
"Coruna nasci" is said by Petronius, in a general sense, of one in
great distress. As applied to a cuckold, it is common to most of
the modern European languages. The Italian phrase is "becco
cornuto" (horned goat), which the Accademici della Crusca explain
by averring that that animal, unlike others can without anger bear
a rival in his female's love.</p>
<p>"Dr. Burn, in his <i>History of Westmoreland</i>, would trace
this <i>crest</i> of <i>cuckoldom</i> to horns worn as crests by
those who went to the Crusades, as their armorial distinctions; to
the infidelity of consorts during their absence, and to the finger
of scorn pointed at them on their return; crested indeed, but
abused."&mdash;<i>Todd's Johnson's Dictionary</i>.</p>
<p class="author">R.T.H.G.</p>
<p><i>Why Moses represented with Horns.</i>&mdash;You may inform
your querist "L.C." (No. 24 p. 383.), that the strange practice of
making Moses appear horned, which is not confined to statues, arose
from the mistranslation of Exod. xxxiv. 30. &amp; 35. in the
Vulgate, which is to the Romanist his authenticated scripture. For
there he reads "faciem Moysi cornutum," instead of "the skin of
Moses' face shone." The Hebrew verb put into our type is
<i>coran</i>, very possibly the root of the Latin <i>cornu</i>: and
its primary signification is to put forth horns; its secondary, to
shoot forth rays, to shine. The participle is used in its primary
sense in Psalms, xix. 31.; but the Greek Septuagint, and all
translators <i>from the Hebrew</i> into modern European languages,
have assigned to the verb its secondary meaning in Exod. xxxiv. In
that chapter the nominative to <i>coran</i> is, in both verses,
undeniably <i>skin</i>, not <i>head</i> nor <i>face</i>. Now it
would obviously be absurd to write "his skin was horned," so that
common sense, and the authority of the Septuagint, supported by the
language of St. Paul in his paraphrase and comment on this passage
in 2 Cor. iii. 7-13., ought to have been sufficient to guide any
Christian translator as to the sense to be attached to <i>coran</i>
in the mention of Moses.</p>

<p><i>Ecclesiastical Year</i> (No. 24. p. 381.).&mdash;The
following note on the calendar is authority for the statement
respecting the beginning of the ecclesiastical year:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Note that the Golden Number and the Dominicall letter doeth
change euery yeere the first day of January. Note also, that the
yeere of our Lord beginneth the xxv. day of March, the same
supposed to be the first day upon which the world was created, and
the day when Christ was conceived in the womb of the Virgin
Mary."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As in the Book of Common Prayer, Lond. 1614, p. 2. Bishop Cosins
remarks, "beginneth the 25th day of March."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Romani annum suum auspicantur ad calendas Januarias. Idem
faciunt hodierni Romani et qui in aliis regnis pap&aelig;
authoritatem agnoseunt. Ecclesia autem Anglicana sequitur
suppotationem antiquam a Dionysio Exiguo inchoatum, anno Christi
532."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nicholl's Commentary on the Book of Common Prayer, additional
notes, p. 10. Fol. Lond. 1712, vid. loe.</p>
<p>In the Book of Common Prayer, Oxford, 1716, the note
is,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<i>Note.</i>&mdash;The supputation of the year of our Lord in
the Church of England beginneth the five-and-twentieth day of
March."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This note does not now appear in our Prayer Books, being
omitted, I suppose, in consequence <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page421" id="page421"></a>{421}</span> of the adoption of the new
style in England in 1752. The daily course of lessons used to
begin, as it does now, with the Book of Genesis and of St. Matthew,
in January; the collects, epistles, and gospels with those for
Advent.</p>

<p><i>Paying through the Nose</i> (No. 21. p. 335.).&mdash;I have
always understood this to be merely a degenerated pronunciation of
the last word. Paying through <i>the noose</i> gives the idea so
exactly, that, as far as the etymology goes, it is explanatory
enough. But whether <i>that</i> reading has an historical origin
may be another question. It scarcely seems to need one.</p>
<p class="author">C.W.H.</p>
<p><i>Quem Deus vult perdere, &amp;c.</i> (No. 22. p.
351.).&mdash;The correct reading is, "Quem Jupiter vult perdere,
dementat prius." See Duport's <i>Gnomologia Homerica</i>, p. 282.
(Cantab. 1660.) Athenagoras quotes Greek lines, and renders them in
Latin (p. 121. Oxon. 1682):</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"At d&aelig;mon homini quum struit aliquid malum,</p>
<p>Pervertit illi primitus mentem suam."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The word "dementat" is not to be met with, I believe, in the
works of any real classical author. Butler has employed the idea in
part 3. canto 2. line 565. of <i>Hudibras</i>:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Like men condemned to thunderbolts,</p>
<p>Who, ere the blow, become mere dolts."</p>

<p class="author">C.I.R.</p>
<p><i>Shrew</i> (No. 24. p. 381.).&mdash;The word, I apprehend,
means sharp. The mouse, which is not the field-mouse, as Halliwell
states, but an animal of a different order of quadrupeds, has a
very sharp snout. Shrewd means sharp generally. Its bad sense is
only incidental. They seem connected with scratch; screw; shrags,
the end of sticks or furze (Halliwell); to shred (A.-S., screadan,
but which must be a secondary form of the verb). That the
shrew-mouse is called in Latin <i>sorex</i>, seems to be an
accidental coincidence. That is said to be derived from [Greek:
urax]. The French have confounded the two, and give the name
<i>souris</i> to the common mouse, but <i>not</i> to the
shrew-mouse.</p>
<p>I protest, for one, against admitting that Broc is derived from
<i>broc</i>, persecution, which of course is participle from break.
We say "to badger" for to annoy, to teaze. I suppose two centuries
hence will think the name of the animal is derived from that verb,
and not the verb from it. It means also, in A.-S., <i>equus
vilis</i>, a horse that is worn out or "broken down."</p>
<p class="author">C.B.</p>
<p><i>Zenobia</i> (No. 24. p. 383.).&mdash;Zenobia is said to be
"gente Judaea," in Hoffman's <i>Lexicon Universale</i>, and
Facciolati, ed. Bailey, Appendix, voc. <i>Zenobia</i>.</p>

<p><i>Cromwell's Estates</i> (No. 24. p. 389.).&mdash;There is
Woolaston, in Gloucestershire, four miles from Chepstow, chiefly
belonging now to the Duke of Beaufort.</p>
<p class="author">C.B.</p>
<p><i>Vox et pr&aelig;terea Nihil</i> (No. 16. p. 247., and No. 24.
p. 387.).&mdash;This saying is to be found in Plutarch's <i>Laconic
Apophthegms</i> ([Greek: Apophthegmata Lakonika]), Plutarchi
<i>Opera Moralia</i>, ed. Dan. Wyttenbach, vol. i. p. 649.</p>
<p>Philemon Holland has "turned it into English" thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Another [Laconian] having plucked all the feathers off from a
nightingale, and seeing what a little body it had: 'Surely,' quoth
he, 'thou art all voice, and nothing else.'"&mdash;<i>Plutarch's
Morals</i>, fol. 1603. p. 470.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="author">W.B.R.</p>
<p><i>Law of Horses.</i>&mdash;The following is from Oliphant's
<i>Law of Horses, &amp;c.</i>, p. 75. Will any of your readers
kindly tell me whether the view is correct?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It is said in <i>Southerene</i> v. <i>Howe</i> (2 Rol. Rep.
5.), <i>Si home vend chivall que est lame, null action gist peur
ceo, mes</i> caveat emptor: <i>lou jeo vend chivall que ad null
oculus la null action gist; autrement lou il ad un conterfeit faux
et</i> bright eye." "If a man sell a horse which is lame, no action
lyes for that, but <i>caveat emptor</i>; and when I sell a horse
that has <i>no</i> eye, there no action lies; otherwise where he
has a counterfeit, false, and <i>bright eye</i>."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus it appears that a distinction is here made between a horse
having <i>no</i> eye at all, and having a counterfeit, false or
<i>bright</i> one. And probably by <i>bright eye</i> is meant
<i>glass eye</i>, or <i>gutta serena</i>; and the words
"counterfeit" and "false" may be an attempt of the reporter to
explain an expression which he did not understand. Because putting
a false eye into a horse is far in advance of the sharpest
practices of the present day, or of any former period.</p>
<p>Note.&mdash;<i>Gutta Serena</i>, commonly called glass-eye, is a
species of blindness; the pupil is unusually dilated; it is
immovable, bright, and glassy.</p>

<p><i>Christ's Hospital.</i>&mdash;In reply to "NEMO" (No. 20. p.
318.), a contemporary of the eminent Blues there enumerated,
informs him, that although he has not a perfect recollection of the
ballads then popular at Christ's Hospital, yet "NEMO" may be
pleased to learn, that on making search at the Society of
Antiquaries for Robin Hood Ballads, he found in a folio volume of
Broadsides, &amp;c., one of the much interest and considerable
length in relation to that school. The Ballad must also be rare, as
it is not among those in the two large volumes which have been for
many years in the British Museum, nor is it in the three volumes of
Roxburgh Ballads recently purchased for that noble library.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page422" id=
"page422"></a>{422}</span>
<p>The undersigned believes that the only survivor of the scholars
at Christ's Hospital mentioned by "NEMO," is the Rev. Charles
Valentine Le Grice, now residing at Trerieffe, near Penzance.</p>
<p class="author">J.M.G.</p>
<p>Worcester, March 22. 1850.</p>
<p class="note">[We are happy to say that one other, at least, of
the Christ Hospital worthies enumerated by "NEMO" still
survives&mdash;Mr. Leigh Hunt, whose kindly criticism and real
poetic feeling have enriched our literature with so many volumes of
pleasant reading, and won for him the esteem of a large circle of
admirers.]</p>
<p><i>Tickhill, God help me!</i> (No. 16. p. 247.).&mdash;"H.C. ST.
CROIX" informs us that a similar expression is in use in
Lincolnshire. Near to the town of "merry Lincoln" is a large heath
celebrated for its cherries. If a person meets one of the
cherry-growers on his way to market, and asks him where he comes
from, the answer will be, if the season is favourable, "From
Lincoln Heath, where should 'un?" but if, on the contrary, there is
a scarcity of cherries, the reply will be, "From Lincoln Heath, God
help 'un."</p>
<p>"DISS" informs us, too, that this saying is not confined to
Tickhill, Melverly, or Pershore, but is also current at Letton, on
the banks of the Wye, between Hereford and Hay. And "H.C.P." says
the same story is told of the inhabitants of Tadley, in the north
of Hampshire, on the borders of Berkshire.</p>
<p><i>Robert Long</i> (No. 24. p. 382.).&mdash;Rear-Admiral Robert
Long died 4th <i>July</i>, 1771, having been superannuated on the
half-pay of rear-admiral some time before his death. His seniority
in the navy was dated from 21st March, 1726, and he was posted in
the Shoreham. He never was <i>Sir</i> Robert. An account of the
charity he founded may be seen in the <i>Commissioners' Reports on
Charities</i>, vol. iii. iv. vi.</p>

the end of each volume is an alphabet, with six columns, one for
each vowel; in one or other of which the word is entered according
to the vowel which first appears in it, with a reference to the

<h3>MISCELLANIES.</h3>
<p><i>MSS. of Casaubon.</i>&mdash;There is a short statement
respecting certain MSS., now existing, of the great critic
Casaubon, in a recent volume of the Parker Society&mdash;Whitaker's
<i>Disputation on Holy Scripture</i>, edited and translated by
Professor Fitzgerald, Professor of Moral Philosophy, Dublin, which
I conceive is one of those facts which might be of service at some
future time to scholars, from having been recorded in your
columns:&mdash;</p>
<p>Whitaker having observed&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"One Herman, a most impudent papist, affirms that the scriptures
are of no more avail than Aesop's fables, apart from the testimony
of the church."&mdash;(Parker Soc. transl., p. 276.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Professor Fitzgerald appends the following "note:"&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Casaubon, Exercit. Baron. I. xxxiii. had, but doubtfully,
attributed this to Pighius; but in a MS. note preserved in Primate
Marsh's library, at St. Sepulchre's, Dublin, he corrects himself
thus: 'Non est hic, sed quidam Hermannus, ait Wittakerus in
Pr&aelig;fat. Controvers. I. Qu&aelig;st. S. p. 314.' If a new
edition of those Exercitations be ever printed, let not these MSS.
of that great man, which, with many other valuable records, we owe
to the diligence of Stillingfleet and the munificence of Marsh, be
forgotten."</p>

<p><i>St. Antholin's Parish Books.</i>&mdash;In common with many of
your antiquarian readers, I look forward with great pleasure to the
selection from the entries in the St. Antholin's Parish Books,
which are kindly promised by their present guardian, and, I may
add, intelligent expositor, "W.C."</p>
<p>St. Antholin's is, on several accounts, one of the most
interesting of our London churches; it was here, Strype tells us
(<i>Annals</i>, I. i. p. 199.), "the new morning prayer,"
<i>i.e.</i>, according to the new reformed service-book, first
began in September, 1559, the bell beginning to ring at five, when
a psalm was sung after the Geneva fashion, all the congregation,
men, women, and boys, singing together. It is much to be regretted
that these registers do not extend so far back as this year, as we
might have found in them entries of interest to the Church
historian; but as "W.C." tells us the volumes are kept regularly up
to the year 1708, I cannot but hope he may be able to produce some
notices of what Mr. P. Cunningham calls, "the Puritanical fervour"
of this little parish. "St. Antling's bell," and "St. Antling's
preachers," were proverbial for shrillness and prolixity, and the
name is a familiar one to the students of our old dramatists. Let
"W.C." bear in mind, that the chaplains of the Commissioners of the
Church of Scotland, with Alexander Henderson at their head,
preached here in 1640, commanding crowded audiences, and that a
passage was formed from the house where they lodged into a gallery
of this church; and that the pulpit of St. Antholin's seems, for
many years, to have been the focus of schism, faction, and
sedition, and he may be able to bring forward from these happily
preserved registers much interesting and valuable information.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
